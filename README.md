Welcome! 

    This project is a simulation of an animal study deisgned to test various drugs on mice with squamous cell carcinoma, commonly known as skin cancer. The study includes over 200 mice with tumors of various sizes who are then treated with various drugs over time. Mice tumors were measured over time to determine the efficacy of the drugs used, and mice weight was tracked as well. 

    Initially Pandas was used to do some data cleaning and merging in order to make a dataframe, and from that point forward various tools were used to make calculations and dive deeper into the over 1,000 rows of data.
    
    I used a mixture of Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to determine the most effacious drugs, as well as to create charts that visualize the findings. Towards the end you will see that I was able to plot and calculate the correlation between mice weight and tumor size. 

    Enjoy!
